# CodeCompanion Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved in This Session

### 1. ✅ Terminal Output Capture Issue
**Problem**: Commands executed successfully but AI couldn't see the output
**Solution**: Fixed end marker detection to wait for actual command output instead of stopping at command echo

### 2. ✅ Browser Webview Errors (ERR_ABORTED)
**Problem**: Repetitive error spam from sites blocking webviews
**Solution**: Added error suppression and retry limiting for blocked sites

### 3. ✅ EventEmitter Memory Leaks
**Problem**: MaxListenersExceededWarning due to accumulating event listeners
**Solution**: 
- Fixed browser initialization event listeners
- Added proper cleanup for page load listeners
- Implemented fail-safe cleanup on timeout

### 4. ✅ Script Execution Errors
**Problem**: "Script failed to execute" errors during startup
**Solution**: Deferred UI component initialization until after DOM is ready

## Technical Details

### Modified Files:
1. **app/tools/terminal_session.js**
   - Enhanced output capture with double end marker detection
   - Improved command echo filtering

2. **app/chat/tabs/browser.js**

## Current Status:
- ✅ Terminal commands work with proper output capture
- ✅ No script execution errors on startup
- ✅ No memory leak warnings
- ✅ Webview errors properly suppressed
- ✅ All UI components initialize correctly

The app now starts cleanly and runs without console spam or errors!
