# Session Summary - Research Agent Web Support Fix

## Problem Identified
The research agent was experiencing an infinite loop when tasked with web-based research. The AI would repeatedly attempt to explore project files using `ls -R` commands instead of performing the requested web searches. This occurred because:


1. The research agent only had access to project-specific tools (`read_files`, `search_codebase`)
2. No web search tools were available in the planner tools module
3. The system prompt didn't distinguish between web research and project research contexts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Research Tools (`app/chat/planner/tools.js`)
- Added `GoogleSearch` and `contextualCompress` imports
- Created `webSearch` async function that:
  - Uses Google Search API to get up to 30 results
  - Returns structured JSON with results, URLs, titles, and snippets
- Added `webSearchTool` definition with proper parameters
- Modified `tools()` function to accept `includeWebSearch` parameter
- Tools are now dynamically selected based on research context

### 2. Smart Context Detection (`app/chat/planner/researchAgent.js`)
- Added `isWebResearchTask()` method that detects web research based on:
  - Explicit `webResearch: true` flag in research items
  - Keywords like 'google', 'github repository', 'open source', 'popular', etc.
- Split system prompts into:
  - `WEB_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS`: Instructs AI to focus on web tools
  - `PROJECT_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS`: For project-based research
- Updated `executeResearch()` to use appropriate tools based on context
- Added simple in-memory cache using Map for research results

### 3. Web Research Item (`app/chat/planner/researchItems.js`)
- Added dedicated `web_research` item type with:
  - Proper output format for web findings
  - `webResearch: true` flag
  - Structured output with findings, sources, and summary

### 4. Main Tools Integration (`app/tools/tools.js`)
- Enhanced `researchAgent()` function to detect web research context
- Automatically marks research items as web research when keywords are detected

### 5. Bug Fixes
- Fixed `isDevelopment` undefined error in `app/utils.js`
- Added missing cache Map in research agent

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that confirmed:
- Research agent correctly identifies web research tasks
- Web search tool is included in available tools
- System prompt properly instructs AI to use web search
- No attempts to explore project files for web research

## Result
The research agent now correctly handles web-based research tasks without falling into infinite loops of project file exploration. When asked to find information about GitHub repositories, open source projects, or other web content, it uses the web search tool appropriately.

## Files Modified
1. `app/chat/planner/tools.js` - Added web search capability
2. `app/chat/planner/researchAgent.js` - Added context detection and smart prompts
3. `app/chat/planner/researchItems.js` - Added web research item type
4. `app/tools/tools.js` - Enhanced research agent function
5. `app/utils.js` - Fixed isDevelopment undefined error
6. `Map.md` - Documented the bug fix

# CodeCompanion Terminal Bug Fix Session Summary

## Issue Encountered
The terminal functionality in CodeCompanion was experiencing multiple issues:

1. **Malformed command execution**: Commands were being concatenated incorrectly, resulting in output like:
   ```
   cd "/home/vm/codecompanion_extracted-main"; echo "<<<COMMAND_END>>>pwd; echo "<<<COMMAND_END>>>"tracted-main"; echo "<<<COMMAND_END>>>"
   ```

2. **Renderer script execution errors**: Multiple "Script failed to execute" errors in the console

3. **node-pty module errors**: Missing build files causing terminal features to be disabled

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing variable definition**: `isWindows` was used in `terminal_session.js` without being defined
2. **Quote escaping issues**: Shell commands with quotes were not being properly escaped when concatenating with the end marker
3. **Native modules not rebuilt**: node-pty needed to be rebuilt for the current Electron version

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `isWindows` Reference Error
**File**: `app/tools/terminal_session.js`
- Added `const isWindows = process.platform === 'win32';` at the top of the file
- This resolved the undefined variable error that was causing renderer script failures

### 2. Improved Command Execution with End Marker
**File**: `app/tools/terminal_session.js`
- Changed from using `echo` to `printf` for more reliable output:
  ```javascript
  // Old: this.terminal.write(command + '; echo "' + this.endMarker + '"\r');
  // New: 
  if (this.shellType === 'powershell.exe') {
    fullCommand = `${command}; Write-Host "${this.endMarker}"`;
  } else {
    fullCommand = `${command}; printf '%s\\n' '${this.endMarker}'`;
  }
  ```
- Added debug logging to track command execution

### 3. Rebuilt Native Modules
- Ran `npm install @electron/rebuild && npx electron-rebuild`
- This resolved the node-pty module loading issues

## Current Status
✅ **Terminal functionality restored** - Commands execute properly without concatenation errors
✅ **Renderer errors resolved** - No more script execution failures
✅ **node-pty working** - Terminal features are enabled
✅ **Application running** - Multiple Electron processes confirmed running

## Key Files Modified
1. `app/tools/terminal_session.js` - Fixed variable definition and command execution
2. Native modules rebuilt via npm

## Technical Details

### Terminal Session Properties (Previously Missing)
- `this.terminalSessionDataListeners = []` - Properly initialized
- `this.endMarker = '<<<COMMAND_END>>>'` - Command completion marker
- `this.lastCommandAnalysis = null` - Command analysis storage

### Shell Command Execution Flow
1. Command is written to terminal with end marker
2. Data listener waits for end marker in output
3. Output is post-processed to remove control characters
4. Result is returned to the calling function

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test various shell commands with quotes and special characters
2. Verify cd commands work properly
3. Test command output capture for long-running commands
4. Ensure terminal resize events are handled correctly

## Additional Notes
- The persistent shell manager (`app/core/persistent-shell-manager.js`) uses a different marker (`<<<COMMAND_COMPLETE>>>`) but operates independently
- Real-time terminal monitoring is integrated for error detection
- The fix maintains compatibility with PowerShell, Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells

## Additional Terminal Directory Fix (Latest)

### Issue
- Terminal was starting in home directory (`~`) instead of project directory
- `pwd` command was timing out because terminal wasn't in the expected directory
- App reported working directory as `/home/vm` instead of `/home/vm/codecompanion_extracted-main`

### Root Cause
- Agent constructor was always setting `currentWorkingDir` to `os.homedir()`
- Terminal wasn't navigating to project directory on initialization

### Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Agent Working Directory**
   - Modified `app/chat/agent.js` to use project path when available
   - Falls back to home directory only if no project is loaded

2. **Fixed Terminal Initialization**
   - Terminal now starts in the correct project directory
   - Added fallback logic to ensure proper directory is used

3. **Improved getCurrentDirectory Method**
   - Increased timeout from 500ms to 2000ms
   - Added better error handling and recovery
   - Fixed promise handling with `withTimeout`

4. **Added Directory Navigation on Shell Creation**
   - Terminal automatically navigates to project directory after creation
   - Ensures consistent working directory across sessions

## Critical Bug Fixes (Latest Session)

### 1. Terminal Commands Not Auto-Executing
**Issue**: Commands were being displayed in terminal but not executed - user had to press Enter manually

**Root Cause**: 
- `executeShellCommand` was using `this.terminal.write()` which only displays text
- Data listener was incorrectly set up on `terminal.onData` instead of IPC events

**Fix** (in `app/tools/terminal_session.js`):
- Added `this.writeToShell(fullCommand + '\r')` to actually send command to shell
- Changed data listener to use `ipcRenderer.on('shell-data', dataListener)`
- Fixed cleanup to properly remove IPC listeners

### 2. Search Tool Null Reference Error
**Issue**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'search')" error

**Root Cause**: 
- `RelevantFilesFinder` was trying to search when no project was loaded
- Missing null checks for project controller

**Fix** (in `app/chat/relevant_files_finder.js`):
- Added null check for `chatController.agent?.projectController?.currentProject`
- Returns empty Map when no project is loaded
- Fixed return type consistency (was mixing [] and Map)

### 3. Wrong API Being Used
**Issue**: App was using hardcoded OpenAI/OpenRouter API instead of configured Anthropic API

**Root Cause**:
- `llm_apply.js` had hardcoded API credentials
- Not using the configured model from chat controller

**Fix** (in `app/tools/llm_apply.js`):
- Removed hardcoded API credentials
- Updated to use `chatController.smallModel` instead
- Proper error handling for model responses
