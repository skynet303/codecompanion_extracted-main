# Session Summary - Research Agent Web Support Fix

## Problem Identified
The research agent was experiencing an infinite loop when tasked with web-based research. The AI would repeatedly attempt to explore project files using `ls -R` commands instead of performing the requested web searches. This occurred because:


1. The research agent only had access to project-specific tools (`read_files`, `search_codebase`)
2. No web search tools were available in the planner tools module
3. The system prompt didn't distinguish between web research and project research contexts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Research Tools (`app/chat/planner/tools.js`)
- Added `GoogleSearch` and `contextualCompress` imports
- Created `webSearch` async function that:
  - Uses Google Search API to get up to 30 results
  - Returns structured JSON with results, URLs, titles, and snippets
- Added `webSearchTool` definition with proper parameters
- Modified `tools()` function to accept `includeWebSearch` parameter
- Tools are now dynamically selected based on research context

### 2. Smart Context Detection (`app/chat/planner/researchAgent.js`)
- Added `isWebResearchTask()` method that detects web research based on:
  - Explicit `webResearch: true` flag in research items
  - Keywords like 'google', 'github repository', 'open source', 'popular', etc.
- Split system prompts into:
  - `WEB_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS`: Instructs AI to focus on web tools
  - `PROJECT_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS`: For project-based research
- Updated `executeResearch()` to use appropriate tools based on context
- Added simple in-memory cache using Map for research results

### 3. Web Research Item (`app/chat/planner/researchItems.js`)
- Added dedicated `web_research` item type with:
  - Proper output format for web findings
  - `webResearch: true` flag
  - Structured output with findings, sources, and summary

### 4. Main Tools Integration (`app/tools/tools.js`)
- Enhanced `researchAgent()` function to detect web research context
- Automatically marks research items as web research when keywords are detected

### 5. Bug Fixes
- Fixed `isDevelopment` undefined error in `app/utils.js`
- Added missing cache Map in research agent

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that confirmed:
- Research agent correctly identifies web research tasks
- Web search tool is included in available tools
- System prompt properly instructs AI to use web search
- No attempts to explore project files for web research

## Result
The research agent now correctly handles web-based research tasks without falling into infinite loops of project file exploration. When asked to find information about GitHub repositories, open source projects, or other web content, it uses the web search tool appropriately.
