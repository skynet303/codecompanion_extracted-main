# Terminal Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The terminal in the CodeCompanion Electron app was not responding to keyboard input. Users could see the terminal but couldn't type into it.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Initialization Timing Fix**
- Added a 100ms delay before initializing the terminal to ensure DOM elements are ready
- Added try-catch blocks with fallback mechanisms
- File: `renderer.js`

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added checks for terminal element existence before initialization
- Added informative error messages for debugging
- Added shell error handling via IPC
- File: `app/tools/terminal_session.js`

### 3. **Focus Management**
- Added click handler to focus terminal when clicked
- Added tab show event handler to focus terminal when switching tabs
- Ensures terminal can receive keyboard input
- File: `app/tools/terminal_session.js`

### 4. **IPC Listener Cleanup**
- Removed duplicate IPC listeners that could cause input conflicts
- Uses `removeAllListeners` before adding new ones
- File: `app/tools/terminal_session.js`

### 5. **CSS Improvements**
- Ensured terminal container has proper dimensions (100% width/height)
- Added explicit cursor visibility styles
- Added viewport scrolling styles
- File: `styles/styles.css`

### 6. **Debug Utilities**
- Added `debugTerminal()` method for troubleshooting
- Created `test-terminal.js` script for console testing
- Added comprehensive logging throughout terminal initialization

## How to Test

### 1. Install Dependencies (REQUIRED)
```bash
# First, install all dependencies - THIS IS REQUIRED!
npm install

# This may take a few minutes as it downloads all packages
# including electron, xterm, and node-pty
```

### 2. Rebuild Native Modules
```bash
# After installing, rebuild native modules (required for node-pty)
npm run rebuild

# This rebuilds node-pty for your specific platform and Electron version
```

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
# Start the app
npm start

# OR for development mode with DevTools auto-opened
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Terminal Functionality
1. Click on the "Shell" tab in the right panel
2. The terminal should initialize and show a prompt
3. Click inside the terminal to focus it
4. Try typing commands like:
   - `echo "Hello World"`
   - `pwd`
   - `ls`

### 5. Debug Terminal Issues
If the terminal still doesn't work:

1. Open Developer Console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Copy and paste the contents of `test-terminal.js` into the console
3. Run `testTerminal()` in the console
4. Check the console output for diagnostic information

### 6. Manual Debug Commands
In the Developer Console, you can also run:

```javascript
// Check if terminal exists
chatController.terminalSession.terminal

// Debug terminal state
chatController.terminalSession.debugTerminal()

// Try to create terminal manually
chatController.terminalSession.createShellSession()

// Focus terminal
chatController.terminalSession.terminal.focus()
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: npm install fails with node-pty errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
# On Windows, you may need build tools:
npm install --global windows-build-tools

# On Linux/Mac, ensure you have build essentials:
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
# macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

### Issue: "Terminal not available. Please rebuild native modules."
**Solution**: Run `npm run rebuild` to rebuild node-pty for your platform

### Issue: Terminal appears but no cursor/can't type
**Solution**: 
1. Click inside the terminal to focus it
2. Check if the shell process started correctly in the console logs

### Issue: "Terminal container not found"
**Solution**: Refresh the application (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

## Files Modified
- `renderer.js` - Added initialization delay and error handling
- `app/tools/terminal_session.js` - Main terminal fixes
- `styles/styles.css` - Terminal styling improvements
- `test-terminal.js` - Debug utility script (new file)
- `Map.md` - Updated documentation

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Check the main process console for errors (run with `npm run dev`)
2. Verify node-pty is properly installed for your platform
3. Check if antivirus/security software is blocking shell access
4. Try different shells (PowerShell on Windows, bash/zsh on Unix)
5. Report specific error messages from the console

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows
- Uses PowerShell by default
- May require execution policy changes
- Run as Administrator if permission issues occur

### macOS
- Uses zsh by default
- May require terminal permissions in System Preferences

### Linux
- Uses bash by default
- Ensure xterm is installed on the system
